スターウォーズ,,{},Star wars was interesting,Star Wars,"ウォ　is typed like who"
子供,こども,{'供': 24},"when I was a child, I used to be cute",Child,"The readings for this one are the kun'yomi readings of each kanji. 子 is just こ, like the individual vocab word. 供 is ども, however. Remember this by thinking how much children love domo-kun. Also, 子ども is kind of more 'politically correct' with the kana hanging off there. 子供 is still used in a lot of situations, usually stiff ones. The second kanji means servant, and some people don't like that. The second version pops up a decent amount, so it's good to be familiar with that as well."

Though this is for a warm weather or temperature, not some warm food or something like that, that would be 温かい, a different あたたかい. Confusing, right? The reading is the same like 温かい, which also means warm, though it refers to a warm thing unlike 暖かい which refers to a warm temperature or place. *Note that あったかい is for spoken Japanese. The 'correct' reading is still あたたかい. But we've added this reading too for you chattygattors out there."
